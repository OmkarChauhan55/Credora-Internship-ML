## House Price Prediction
This is a simple Machine Learning project from my internship at Credora. The goal is to predict house prices using a basic Linear Regression model with a few house details.

## What is this project?
Use data from Kaggle
Clean and prepare the data
Pick important features
Build a Linear Regression model
Check how well it predicts house prices

## Features used
GrLivArea: Size of the living area (in sq.ft)
BedroomAbvGr: Number of bedrooms
FullBath: Number of bathrooms

## Tools
Python
Pandas (for data handling)
NumPy (for calculations)
Scikit-learn (for ML model)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for graphs)

## Results summary
MAE: ~1,21,531
RMSE: ~1,44,296
R²: -0.13

This is a basic model with only 3 features — there’s a lot of room for improvement!
